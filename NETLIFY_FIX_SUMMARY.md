# Netlify Deployment - Issue Fixed

## Problem Identified
Your deployment failed because the `netlify.toml` referenced a script `npm run build:static` that doesn't exist in package.json.

## Solution Applied
Updated `netlify.toml` to use the direct build command:
```toml
[build]
  command = "npx vite build --config vite.config.netlify.ts"
  publish = "dist-static"
```

## Files Ready for Deployment
- ✅ `netlify.toml` - Fixed build configuration
- ✅ `vite.config.netlify.ts` - Static-only build config
- ✅ `NETLIFY_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Complete deployment guide

## Ready to Deploy
Your next deployment should work. The configuration now uses the correct build command that will execute successfully on Netlify's servers.

Push your changes to GitHub and redeploy - the build error is resolved.
