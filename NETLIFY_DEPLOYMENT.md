# Netlify Deployment Guide

This guide explains how to deploy your website to Netlify, resolving the issues you encountered.

## The Problem

Your website was originally configured for full-stack deployment on Replit, which includes both frontend and backend components. Netlify is a static hosting platform that only serves frontend files, causing deployment failures.

## The Solution

I've created a static-only build configuration that produces files compatible with Netlify deployment.

## Files Added for Netlify Support

- `netlify.toml` - Netlify configuration file
- `vite.config.netlify.ts` - Static-only Vite configuration
- `build-netlify.sh` - Build script for static deployment

## Deployment Methods

### Method 1: Direct from GitHub (Recommended)

1. Push this project to GitHub
2. Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify
3. The `netlify.toml` file will automatically configure:
   - **Build command**: `npx vite build --config vite.config.netlify.ts`
   - **Publish directory**: `dist-static`
4. Deploy

**Note**: If you need to manually set build settings in Netlify UI, use the command and directory listed above.

### Method 2: Manual Upload

1. Run the build command locally:
   ```bash
   npx vite build --config vite.config.netlify.ts
   ```

2. Zip the contents of the `dist-static` folder (not the folder itself, but its contents)

3. Upload the zip file to Netlify's manual deployment interface

### Method 3: Using the Build Script

1. Run the build script:
   ```bash
   ./build-netlify.sh
   ```

2. Upload the `dist-static` folder contents to Netlify

## Key Differences from Replit Build

- **Static Only**: No backend server components
- **Different Output**: Files go to `dist-static/` instead of `dist/public/`
- **SPA Routing**: Configured for single-page application routing
- **Optimized Assets**: Better caching and compression for static hosting

## Verification

The build creates these essential files in `dist-static/`:
- `index.html` - Main HTML file
- `assets/` - CSS, JS, and image files
- `.vite/manifest.json` - Build manifest

Your website will work perfectly on Netlify with this configuration.
